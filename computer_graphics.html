							<h2>Geometry Processing and Analysis for Archaeology</h2>
							<p><b>Research Problem</b>: Quickly identifying archaeological features in the form of curvelinear structures 
							</p>
							<p><b>Research Task</b>: (1) Develop an efficient and accurate pipeline archaeology researchers, who are unfamiliar with coding, can easily use 
								(2) Evaluate the accuracy of this tool using Ground-Penetrating-Radar (GPR) data, which exposes similar curvelinear structures underground
							</p>
							<p><b>Actions</b>: (3000+ lines of code) 
							<ol> <!-- change padding: "/* List */" in main.css-->
								<li>Created mesh from very-high-resolution LiDAR point cloud data from sites in Uzbekistan (Screened Poisson Reconstruction)</li>
								<li>Extracted curvelinear features from this mesh using the CrestCODE algorithm</li>
								<li>Extracted curvelinear features from GPR image using the Ridge-Detection algorithm</li>
								<li>Deformed the mesh as well as the curvelinear features to fit the distortion of the GPR image 
									(due to reprojecting to a 2D plane) using the Smooth-Excess-Area algorithm
								<li>Developed a metric to compare the curvelinear features from the deformed mesh and 
									the GPR image</li>
								<li>Calculated summary statistics to identify the accuracy of our method</li>
								<li>Presented our results in the 2022 Undergraduate Research Symposium</li>
								<li>Our project was featured in the WashU's Technical Exchange Planning Meeting with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) </li>
								<li>Discussed with archaeologists to confirm and update expectations for research outcome</li>
								<li>Produced well-documented, modularized code, which I circulated with new PhD students joining this project</li>
								<li>Reported findings in weekly project meetings</li>
								<li>Created an easy-to-use interface for all this automated pipeline</li>
							</ol>
							</p>
								<p><b>Results</b>: 
									<ol>
										<li>Developed an efficient, user-friendly pipeline to automatically idenfity archaeological features in large scale</li>
										<li>Spearheaded and laid foundation for the collaboration between the two labs involved in this project</li>
										<li>Drafting: Reported our findings in a publication

							<h2>Extracting Insect Wings Venations and their Closed Regions from Images</h2>
							<p><b>Research Problem</b>: (1) Automatically identify the venation of insect wings and mutually-exclusive regions they enclose 
								(2) record the extracted curvelinear features in the form of clean SVG images
							</p>
							<p><b>Research Task</b>: (1) Develop a pipeline to extract curvelinear features from images of insect wings 
								(2) Develop a method to identify the small enclosed regions in the wings
								(3) Convert the extracted features into SVG format
							</p>
							<p><b>Actions</b>: (1500+ lines of code)
							<ol> <!-- change padding: "/* List */" in main.css-->
								<li>Studied Seth Donohogue and Christopher Rycroft's work on this topic</li>
								<li>Reached out to them to better understand their methods (segmentation and optimization) and strategies</li>
								<li>Researched similar methods that extracts curvelinear features from 2D images</li>
								<li>Implemented a combination of thresholding, denoising, and skeletonization to quickly extract curvelinear structures</li>
								<li>Stored the extracted features in the forms of nodes and edges in an undirected graph</li>
								<li>Applied the minimum-cycle-basis algorithm to identify mutually-exclusive cycles in this graph, 
									which corresponds to small enclosed areas on the wings of insects like dragonfly or grasshopper
								</li>
								<li>Implementated a workflow to convert the extracted features to SVG at high and low resolutions</li>
								<li>Developed a program to create 3D models from the wings that area ready for 3D-printing</li>
							</ol>
							</p>
								<p><b>Results</b>: 
									<ol>
										<li>Developed an automatic and efficient pipeline to identify curvelinear features in insect wings</li>
										<li>Developed a follow-up workflow to extract the small enclosed areas from a network of those features</li>
										<li>Created an easy, user-friendly interface for artists and researchers who aren't familiar with coding</li>
